Hi, I want to briefly explain how to run the code. It is better to put each task file in the separate folder and put the train_data and validation_data in each folder because different models have different ways to process data. And the model in task3 uses the same data with task4, so task3 and task4 share the same processed data files, which means the processed file generated in task3 should be copied to task4 folder. Especially in task2, glove's pretrained model needs to be downloaded. Thank you!
